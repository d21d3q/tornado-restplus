# tornado-restplus
Framework inspired by flask-restplus

The aim of this project is to provide namespaces for easy routing, and swagger
documentation.

I am planning to use
[marshmallow](https://github.com/marshmallow-code/marshmallow) as model layer
and [apispec](https://github.com/marshmallow-code/apispec) for generating
swagger stuff since they seem to work with tornado (and each other)

## What works for now

* Namespaces with routing
* generating swagger json extracted from comments
* defining marshmallow schemas on api and namespaces
